README

This program takes CSV (comma-separated values) files as input to generate CSV
files that contain all of the data for each variable. To use the NASA Automator,
place all NASA data files in a folder titled 'Input Files', ensure the program
is in the same directory as the 'Input Files' folder and that locations_sub.csv
is in the same directory as the program file and run the program. The program
will automatically create a new folder titled 'Output Files' to store the generated
CSV files. If there is an existing folder titled 'Output Files', it will use that
folder. If there are existing CSV files in the 'Output Files' folder titled exactly
as the program generates, those files will be overwritten. Otherwise, new files
will be created alongside existing files in the folder. There is a hidden .git
folder in the project directory to privately back up the project online, it will
have no effect on the program functionality.
